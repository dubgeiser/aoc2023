# Advent Of Code 2023
My solutions for Advent Of Code 2023

This year, I'm trying Go... a whole new/different programming language for me.

Code is up for grabs, public domain.

Every day will be a directory, with 1 `main.go` file that has 2 functions, `part1` and `part2`.
I cannot explain where the inspiration comes from.

Puzzles should normally be found on https://adventofcode.com/2023/


## TODO / REVISIT

### Day 5, part 2
Took the easy route and let the program run for a couple of minutes... Answer was found < 3', I'll take it for now :-D.

Think it should be rewritten with calculating the min. location for ranges or something (haven't yet thought about it)
